I will start as a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Earth System Science at University of California, Irvine in Feb 2024. My research interests involve stratified shear instability's role in ocean mixing. I am also interested in flow-topography interactions, such as island wakes and flow over ocean ridges. Using numerical simulations and theories, I aim to understand the complex dynamics of ocean mixing and its impact on the Earth system.

I recently completed my PhD at Oregon State University, working with [Bill Smyth](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/salty/) on Kelvin-Helmholtz Turbulence in Complex Environments.
